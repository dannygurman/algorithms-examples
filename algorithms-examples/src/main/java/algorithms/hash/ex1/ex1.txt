Given an array of size N, with negative and positive numbers, non repetitive and no 0,

 give an algorithm to print out any 3 indexes such that the sum of elements of the array in those
 indexes is 0 (Give just one triplet or output nine if there aren't any).

 Give time and space complexity.

  Write in psuedocode if you wish.
