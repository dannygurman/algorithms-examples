/*
Space Optimized Version
The Method 1  approach can be optimized.
We can limit the number of elements in the auxiliary stack.
We can push only when the incoming element of the main stack
is smaller than or EQUAL to the top of the auxiliary stack.

Similarly during pop, if the pop-off element EQUAL to the top of the auxiliary stack,
remove the top element of the auxiliary stack.

Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity:
For Insert operation: O(1) (As insertion ‘push’ in a stack takes constant time)
For Delete operation: O(1) (As deletion ‘pop’ in a stack takes constant time)
For ‘Get Min’ operation: O(1) (As we have used an auxiliary which has it’s top as the minimum element)

Auxiliary Space: O(n).
The complexity in the worst case is the same as above(!) but in other cases,
it will take SLIGHTLY less space than the above approach as repetition is neglected.
