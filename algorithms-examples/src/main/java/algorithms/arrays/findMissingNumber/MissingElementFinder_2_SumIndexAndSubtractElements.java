/*
Iterating - sum index and subtracting current value

Approach: The approach remains the same but there can be overflow if n is large.
In order to avoid integer overflow iterating over array , adding element value and subtract index

Create a variable sum = 1 which will store the missing number and a counter variable c = 2.
Traverse the array from start to end.
Update the value of sum as sum = sum â€“ array[i] + c and update c as c++.
Print the missing number as a sum.

* Complexity Analysis:
    * Time Complexity: O(n).
    * Only one traversal of the array is needed.
    * Space Complexity: O(1).*/
