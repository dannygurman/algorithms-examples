Approach :

Note 1 : When you consider a1 and aN, then the area is (N-1) * min(a1, aN).
Note 2 : The base (N-1) is the maximum possible.

This implies that if there was a better solution possible, it will definitely have the Height
greater than min(a1, aN).
 Base * Height > (N-1) * min(a_1, a_N)

We know that, Base < N-1
->
Height > min(a_1, a_N)
This means that we can discard min(a1, aN) from our set !
and look to solve this problem again from the start.

If a1 < aN, then the problem reduces to solving the same thing for a2, aN.
Else, it reduces to solving the same thing for a1, aN-1
